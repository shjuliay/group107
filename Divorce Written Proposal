# DIVORCE PREDICTION USING CORRELATION BASED FEATURE SELECTION AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS
### Introduction

Within the scope of this research, the divorce prediction was carried out by using the Divorce Predictors Scale (DPS) on the basis of Gottman couples therapy. 
Of the participants, 84 (49%) were divorced and 86 (51%) were married couples. Participants completed the “Personal Information Form” and “Divorce Predictors Scale”. 
Our study aims to find the most significant features/items in the Divorce Predictors Scale that affect the divorce. The most effective 6 features and their values of 
significance obtained by applying the correlation-based feature selection method on the divorce data set. Then, we will apply the direct classification method to find 
the highest success rate. 

The data set we will analyze is in csv format. From a total of 54 attributes we have chosen the following six:

1. I know we can ignore our differences, even if things get hard sometimes.

2. We don't have time at home as partners.

3. I think that one day in the future, when I look back, I see that my spouse and I have been in harmony with each other.

4. My spouse and I have similar ideas about how marriage should be

5. I know my spouse's basic anxieties.

6. We're just starting a discussion before I know what's going on.
